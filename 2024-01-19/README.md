  * Scenes / Nodes / Signals / Trees
    * Nodes, scenes, the scene tree, and signals are four core concepts in Godot that you will manipulate all the time.
      * Nodes are your game's smallest building blocks. You combine them to create scenes that you then combine and nest into the scene tree. You can then use signals to make nodes react to events in other nodes or different scene tree branches.
    * Scenes
      * Game is broken down into these
        * A scene can be a character, a weapon, a menu in the user interface, a single house, an entire level, or anything you can think of.
          * You can also nest scenes
    * Nodes
      * Scenes composed of nodes.
      * Nodes are your game's smallest building blocks that you arrange into trees.
      * Godot provides an extensive library of base node types you can combine and extend to build more powerful ones.
    * Signals
      * Nodes emit signals when some event occurs.
      * "Events" -> can be emitted
