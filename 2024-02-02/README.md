# Flutter

# TODO

* Review Dart Language
* Setup
  * Add flutter to path
    * `export PATH="$PATH:/Users/cj/Downloads/flutter/bin"`
* Build a Twitch Chat App

# Impressions / What I learned

* What I learned
  * Very similar to react
    * Composition of UI Elements
    * Way we work with State
  * Dart is very approachable for JS Devs
* What I Did like?
  * Dev Tools are Amazing
  * hot reload is fast
* What do I not like?
  * The way of composing widgets seems like it could get out of hand / messy
  * State management is a little funky
  * We chose a library that was slightly broken and didn't have the best docs...
* Would I use Flutter again?
  * Maybe...
  * Depends on the type of app...
